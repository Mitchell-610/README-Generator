## Installation
First for our installation we will open up our terminal and run "npm init -y", this helps things get setup for us. Next we use the install platform that exists within npm, this can be ran using "npm install" or "npm i". We will need this to install our inquirer package to run the prompts we need. The way we install inquirer is "npm i inquirer@8.2.4". Once all of our packages are downloaded we are ready to go. You will run "node index.js (or whatever your file name is)" and fill out the information accordingly.

## Usage
To use this amazing platform you just simply answer questions and watch the magic happen.

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute. Anything helpful to expand our great desing will be greatly appricated.

## Tests
Test and debug as much as possible. If something new is added run it, if it works push it up and we will review and push to main if necessary.
